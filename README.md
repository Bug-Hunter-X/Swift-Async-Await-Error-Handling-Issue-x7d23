This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift's async/await error handling. The `fetchData` function uses `async throws` to indicate it might throw an error. However, the `try await` within the `Task` block only prints the error to the console; it doesn't halt execution or provide other error handling mechanisms as it should. The solution file offers a more robust way to manage errors using a `do-catch` block.
